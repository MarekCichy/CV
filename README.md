# Marek Cichy - Curriculum

## My current goal
First full-time professional experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## My background
Warsaw-based Portuguese language specialist with 8 years of experience. In this time I've:
- translated over 4000 pages, served as an interpreter for about 400 hours.

- cofounded <a href="https://mandioca.pl">Mandioca</a>, a Latin American graphic novel publisher. 

Currently I teach myself programming in Python, Machine Learning in general and NLP in particular under <a href="https://github.com/stared">Piotr Migda≈Ç</a>'s guidance. 

## Recently finished:

### Projects
