# Marek Cichy - Curriculum

## My current goal
Career transition into a data scientist with focus on NLP from a Polish-Portuguese translation and interpretation role.

## My background
Warsaw-based Portuguese language specialist with 8 years of experience. In this time I've:
- translated over 4000 pages, served as an interpreter for about 400 hours. 
- created and managed <a href="https://audioteka.com/es/">Audioteka.es</a>, the Spanish-speaking version of a Polish audiobook startup
- cofounded <a href="https://mandioca.pl">Mandioca</a>, a Latin American graphic novel publisher. 

Currently I continue self-learning of Python, Machine Learning in general and NLP in particular under <a href="https://github.com/stared">Piotr Migdał</a>'s guidance. I've just finished the <a href="https://omdena.com/challenges/ai-energy">WEC Omdena (AI4Good) energy transition project</a> in the roles of ML Engineer and Task Manager. 

## Portfolio:

### External projects 
- Omdena + World Energy Council project: <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/ai-energy">AI for Energy: Transitioning toward a Sustainable Energy System </a> in the role of ML Engineer

## Probable next steps
### Upgrading the PT/BR Classifier:
- exploring the errors for patterns;
- adding basic XAI to the frontend;
- checking out an LSTM-based version of the classifier.
- broadening the corpus (crowdsourced movie subtitles, YT comments, etc.)

### Writing about:
- PT/BR Classifier pt 2, 
- My experience with collaborative challenges in Omdena

### Reading:
- Introduction to Statistical Learning by Tibshirani et al. (under way)
- Deep Learning in Python by Francois Chollet
